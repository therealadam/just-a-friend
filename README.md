# Just a friend

Pulls everyone you follow on Twitter and tries to match their username on Delicious. Optimizes your social media. Puts bacon in your donuts.

Caveat: this is currently an aspirational README.

## TODO

* Page through friends via Twitter API
* Examine Delicious matches to see how active the user is
* Pretty output
* Beat-box with Biz Markie
